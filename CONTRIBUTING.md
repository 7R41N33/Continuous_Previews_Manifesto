## Contributing to the CP Manifesto

Uffizzi welcomes contributions from everyone - the CP manifesto is meant to be a living document and the repository for sharing and documenting lessons learned and best practices.  
Given the nature of this repository the best contributions typically will come in two forms:

1. Detailed Developer_Stories of how your team has leveraged previews to their benefit, details on how you managed the process and technical aspests, lessons learned, general recommendations, and any suggestions for unique use cases.

2. Recommended adjustments, edits, amendments, and additions to the language and/or diagrams in the manifesto.  If you have an adjustment please detail why you think the change is a necessary improvement.

Detailed stories, case studies, documentation, diagrams, and results are desired.

## Procedures:

-Fork the project on Github
-Make any changes you want to Continuous_Previews_Manifesto, commit them, and push them to your fork
-Create a pull request against main, and a maintainer will come by and review your inputs.  They may ask for some changes or more information, and hopefully your contribution will be merged to the main branch!

## Communication:

If you need any help contributing, several maintainers are on the uffizzi users slack group https://join.slack.com/t/uffizzi/shared_invite/zt-ffr4o3x0-J~0yVT6qgFV~wmGm19Ux9A.  You'll see the channel #cp_manifesto-contributing.
